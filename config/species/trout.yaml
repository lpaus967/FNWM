# TODO EPIC-3: Restore thermal_suitability to 0.25 when temperature data is available
# Original weights: flow=0.30, velocity=0.25, thermal=0.25, stability=0.20
# Temporary weights (no temperature): redistributed thermal weight across other components

  flow_suitability: 0.40      # Increased from 0.30 (absorbed 10% from thermal)
